# Degenderate

### What?

Degenderate is a pure Python package that semi-intelligently de-genders text.

If you're interested, it attempts to follow the [Unesco Guidelines on Gender Neutral Language](http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001149/114950mo.pdf) (pdf link).

### Why?

Apparently writing non-gendered text for things like contracts is beyond some people. Now they have no excuse.
